M/W 10-11:50pm<br>
Instructor: <a href="https://raghavan.usc.edu">Barath Raghavan</a><br>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>
In this course, we will aim to understand how to formulate a research agenda in Computer Science, examine trends that exist within sub-areas of CS, and identify fruitful and problematic research directions. We will examine barriers to scientific research advancement and how to avoid them when possible. We will practice thinking meta-systematically ("thinking outside of the box") when approaching the selection of research problems and developing research solutions. We will also study prior paradigm-shifting papers in CS research and guidance from eminent Computer Scientists who have articulated what makes for good CS research and strong CS research communities.
<br><br>
The course will explore the hybrid nature of Computer Science -- its existence at the intersection of mathematics, engineering, psychology, philosophy, statistics, and other disciplines -- and how to evaluate progress in CS research as we identify fruitful avenues of future study.  Our focus will not be on any one area of CS; we will examine research agendas in a variety of areas.
<br><br>
The course is intended for CS PhD students in their second year or later who are learning to articulate their own research objectives and plans.
</p>
<hr>
<h3>Course Structure</h3>
<p>The course will involve discussion, presentation, and group work during class.  In addition, students will work individually on an independent project, described below, to describe the past and potential-future research in an area of CS, possibly one that is of interest to the student(s) for future study such as in a dissertation, postdoc, or faculty position.</p>
<br>
<h5>Project</h5>
<p>Computer Science research is diverse in both topic and method, building upon a wide array of adjacent disciplines and also having a rich body of practice of its own. Your task is to develop a research agenda in an area of CS and present this agenda in a variety of forms: 1) as a research whitepaper surveying prior work and describing a future agenda (8+ pages ACM format or equivalent), 2) as a grant one-pager that describes why such work should be funded, 3) as a 30-minute research presentation, 4) as a 10-minute general audience presentation, and 5) as a popular-science article.  Even if you choose to work on your own, you'll be paired up and will be providing peer feedback on a regular basis.  (To this end, you will need to make a complete draft of each milestone available to your partner five days in advance of each deadline, to allow them time to give you feedback and for you to make edits.)</p>
<h5>Readings and Responses</h5>
<p>Per-class assignments will focus on assigned readings and responses to those readings. For each class's assignment, add your responses to an appropriately titled section of your Google Doc, with your most recent additions at the top of the doc. Each day's assignment is due at the start of class that day.</p>
<hr>

<h3>Grading</h3>
<p>Details of grading will be provided in class. Grades will be determined as follows:<br>
<br>
25% Reading responses<br>
25% Peer feedback<br>
50% Project</p>
