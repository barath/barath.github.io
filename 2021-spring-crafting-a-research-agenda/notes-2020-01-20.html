<meta charset="utf-8">

<xmp style="display:none;">
## Course Overview
* Audience: graduate students (or beyond) already engaged in research
  - Not: undergrads
* General Goal: practice thinking about research, but not navel gazing
  - No one-size-fits-all solution, but many methods
  - Make explicit a lot of implicit understanding and know-how
* Concrete Goal: explore the boundaries of some research sub-area of interest to you
  - Or even define a new sub-area
* Non-goals
  - Not: to identify research that will maximize research paper output
  - Not: to preordain a career path, or to say that one career path is better than others
* Diverse readings
  - Across computer science: AI, cryptography, networking, programming languages, etc.
  - Outside of computer science: philosophy, math, sociology, history, etc.
* Challenging
  - Conceptually: will challenge you to think in new ways
  - Practically: a consistent (not bursty) moderately-high reading and writing load
* I want to learn more from you than you learn from me
  - Also: I'd like you to learn more from each other than you learn from me
  - But most importantly: I'd like you to learn the most by yourself through the work

## Perspective
* Who am I to even be teaching this?
  - I am not a senior faculty member
  - I have an unusual background and set of interests
* I could not have taught this course even a few years ago
  - My perspectives have changed
  - My interests have changed
  - The *world* has changed (most importantly)
* Missing subtitle of course: Crafting a Research Agenda in the post-X era
  - where X = modern?
  - where X = truth?
  - where X = science?
  - where X = ???

## No Method
* There is no one method to crafting a research agenda
* Don't believe everything ***you*** think
  - Also don't believe everything you read, even from famous / eminent people
  - But don't reject everything either
* Broken notion: craft a research agenda (or software project, or science experiment)
  - Then do it
* New notion: craft a research agenda and then...
  - You might throw out the whole agenda
  - You might realize its premises were wrong, or goals were wrong, or techniques are ill-suited
  - This is fine, and expected
* Why bother crafting an agenda, then?
  - The *process* of crafting the agenda is key
  - Your agenda can frame a research space, influence others, bring in collaborators and resources
  - It's ok if the document doesn't hold up with 20/20 hindsight; nothing does
* The public agenda and private agenda will be different
  - Public agenda is what you might write in a vision paper
* Private agenda is a meta-agenda, with thoughts on "navigation"
  - Goal is more of "how to navigate" rather than "charting the path from A to B"
  - "Discover the road as you walk it"; you may not end up where you planned
  - What are possible blockers/hurdles to this work? How do you test them, move past them?
  - What are avenues to explore at each potential research crossroads?
  - What are multiple hypothesis/ideas to consider for each sub-problem?
  - What happens when something inevitably goes wrong?
  - What are some possible unknown unknowns; how might they affect problem framing, the work process, the data sets used, etc.?

## "Normal" vs. "Revolutionary" Science
* Our goal is to go beyond "normal" science
  - Aspire to "revolutionary" science
  - However, "normal" science is needed for "revolutionary" science
* "Paradigm shifts" and "revolutionary" science are not solely major changes
  - Both happen at many scales
  - Impossible to categorize all research as strictly "normal" or "revolutionary"
* You will get plenty of practice doing "normal" science as a PhD student
  - Here we aim to discuss something bigger
* Research trends in CS are like economic bubbles
  - [Where is your research area in this chart?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Paul_Rodrigue#/media/File:Stages_of_a_bubble.png)
* The world _demands_ of us something beyond "normal" science at this very not-normal time

## Systems and Meta-systemicity
* Understanding research from a systems perspective
  - Not: computer systems, but: conceptual and rational systems
  - And moving beyond specific systems to a meta-systematic perspective
* We are told we operate in a world of rationality as researchers
  - A fair bit of our discussion will be on why this is often not the case
* Research sometimes employs/requires meta-systematic thinking
  - Thinking this way takes practice
* There is no clear line between systematic and meta-systematic thinking
  - Lots of shades of gray, another theme we will discuss
  - Key is to not get stuck in one way of thinking

## Doing, not just thinking, in a Community of Practice
* How to do good research can't be learned from a book
  - Nor is thinking sufficient
  - Nor is dreaming about grand results sufficient
  - You must ***do*** it, *with others*; lots of hard work
  - Not unique to research: many things are this way
* Example: Computational Agroecology
  - I now do a fair amount of research on applying computing to sustainable agriculture
  - I was trained in networking, but don't use any of it here
  - I never formally studied the ostensible background topics: agriculture, sustainability, AI, etc.
  - I learned the agriculture and sustainabiilty perspectives by doing, embedded in a community of practice (urban agriculturalists, mostly hobbyists but some professionals)
  - I brought my own perspectives and techniques to bear
* You, and your work, get better through those around you
  - Cultivate your community

## Advancement at the Limits of Understanding
* Just "doing" is insufficient; not all work is explicit or conscious
  - Combination of conscious and subconscious work required
* Example: Wagner's cryptanalysis in the hot tub
* Example: ideas in the shower
* Easy to have false insights if you don't put in the work
  - No shortcuts
* Hard to have insights without allowing room for the subconscious
  - Fixating on rational, conscious methods is limiting

## Activities for the Semester, and Beyond
* Read widely, not just in the research literature
  - The literature is a lagging indicator of where research is, sometimes as much as 4 years out of date (why?)
  - You don't want to just read the "best" work
  - Also: read what innovative researchers are themselves reading, so go find out
  - Also: read very broadly, because you never know what might spark ideas
* Don't just read, talk with people
  - The most cutting edge ideas are difficult to articulate in writing
  - New ideas can come out through discussion rather than written dialogue
* Read technical *and* non-technical writing
  - Read technical to learn new techniques for problem solving
  - Read non-technical to consider new problems or problem framings or contexts
* Don't rely upon others to lay out a vision for you
  - Point: You'll just be building their vision
  - Counterpoint: don't just ignore everyone and do your own thing
  - Synthesis: build a community of researchers around a common vision
* Take a lot of notes, not just of ideas but also of what you read
  - Never know what ideas might connect

## Course Mechanics
* Create a new folder in the shared Google Drive folder in the format "Full Name -- CSCI 699"
  - In this folder you'll put all your materials
* The first document you should now create in your folder is "Full Name -- CSCI 699 -- Responses"
  - Clone the template doc and put it in your folder
  - This is where you'll be writing reading responses, newest on top
  - For each class date, should be heading for each class (notes taken in class discussion) and separate heading for reading responses

## Five Whys
* Ask why five times to try to get to root causes
  - We'll apply this later

## Activity
* In groups of 4-5, discuss what "research" is.  Do not look it up online, in a dictionary, etc.
  - What is research *to you* ***in your experience***? (Not what you've been told it is, or read that it is, or think that it should be.)
  - Ask each of the following five times about research: what? who? where? when? why? how?
  - Take notes in your new document
