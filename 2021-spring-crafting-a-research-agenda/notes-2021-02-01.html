## Idea Exploration
* Not enough to just write an idea
  - Easy to come up with ideas, but not good ideas
* Need to force your mind to:
  - Explore the ideas deeply
  - Ask the five whys in problem solving, problem framing, context, and more
  - Hard to get your mind to go there sometimes, to do it (at least for me)

## Fictional Abstracts
* An abstract contains a research paper in miniature:
  - Context
  - New argument or concept
  - Description of work done
  - Summary of results and conclusions
* In most research you have a good sense of the abstraction _before_ doing the work
  - The _form_ of the "answer" is intertwined with the "question"
  - Research results are almost entirely (socially) constructed in CS, not discovered
  - We often even know what results we expect or would like to see
  - Even in ordinary science, a hypothesis is key
* We'll explore this more with Rittel and Webber

## Each good research agenda should yield at least 3 core papers
* Not an exact number, just a rule of thumb.
* If it has less than 3 core papers of material:
  - Not broad enough
  - Less likely to contain a fundamental shift in thinking
* Really speaking should result in many more than 3 papers:
  - Each of the 3 core papers should explore orthogonal aspects of the agenda
  - Each will require followup, in the form of more papers
  - For example, in applied areas, each core paper would likely benefit from one followup on theoretical foundations and one followup on engineering/implementation/applications
* However, beware of mechanistic changes that force re-thinking of everything
  - Easy to devise a superficial idea that requires many papers -- examples?
  - Such examples are often not worth exploring
  - How do we tell them apart from fundamentally-important, new advances?

## Write or die (exercise)
* We'll be using https://writeordie.com/
  - Change settings to 400 words, 15 minutes, 5 sec grace period, kamikaze mode
  - Remember to copy the text from the Write or Die buffer to your doc after each
* Explore the three research agendas, one at a time, through fictional abstracts
  - For each research topic, write 3 fictional abstracts
  - That's _9 total_ fictional abstracts you're going to write in 45 minutes
  - Each abstract should be distinct / non-overlapping
  - The abstracts should span the research topic
  - Good research agendas should have more than 3 papers worth of research to be done
  - 45 minutes in total, 15 for each of the three ideas.
* Then we'll pair up and provide peer feedback
