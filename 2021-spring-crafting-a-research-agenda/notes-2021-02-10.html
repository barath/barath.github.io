## Rules of Thumb
* What are some rules of thumb for how to make progress in research?
  - We do these things all the time, and some are well known but we rarely write them down
  - Sometimes having a checklist is useful when you get stuck, or when you're tired
* Today we'll be developing a list of such rules of thumb
  - Two levels: on solutions and on problems
  - Each rule of thumb should be at most 1 sentence long

## How to solve solutions
* What are concrete things to try when you get stuck solving a problem in your area?

## How to pose problems
* What are things to think about or questions to ask when you get stuck posing/framing a problem?
